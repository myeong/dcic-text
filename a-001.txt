8. DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF AREA:
Terrain:  Level to rolling hillside.   No construction hazard or flood threat.  Land improved 30%.   Highly deed restricted and protected from racial hazards. Conveniences are all readily available with exception of transportation which is as yet only fair.   Street improvements are still in process of construction. This area, located on the southern rim of the San Fernando   Valley, was subdivided some 15 years ago, and substantial street improvements were installed. The depression retarded development.   Under the stimulus of well directed promotional effort and FHA financing a revival started some 4 years ago and it is now one of the "hot spots" in the Valley.   Construction and maintenance are of high quality.   Architectural designs are harmonious.   Location is favorable and attractive.   Population is homogeneous.   Lots are generally of extra size and sold on "homesite" basis and at widely varying prices according to size and location.   The pattern of the area is well established and it is accorded a "low green" grade.
